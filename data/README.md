# Data Directory Structure

## Overview
This directory is intended to store all input data, intermediate processed files, and final results for the cell segmentation and analysis project.

## Top-Level Structure

```
data/
├── raw/                      # Original, unmodified input data
├── processed/                # Processed data (intermediate files)
└── results/                  # Final analysis results & visualizations
```

## Detailed Structure

### `data/raw/`
Contains the original, unmodified input data. It is recommended to back up this data separately.

*   `data/raw/images/`
    *   Store original microscopy images here.
    *   Organize by experiment or dataset if you have multiple (e.g., `data/raw/images/experiment1/`, `data/raw/images/experiment2/`).
    *   Example: `data/raw/images/experiment1/image_01.ome.tif`
*   `data/raw/transcripts/`
    *   Store original transcript data files (e.g., .parquet, .csv).
    *   Organize by experiment, matching the structure in `images/` if applicable.
    *   Example: `data/raw/transcripts/experiment1/transcripts_01.parquet`

### `data/processed/`
Contains intermediate files generated by the pipeline. These can often be regenerated from the raw data if needed.

*   `data/processed/segmentation/`
    *   Outputs from the cell segmentation step.
    *   Should mirror the experiment structure from `data/raw/`.
    *   Example: `data/processed/segmentation/experiment1/image_01_mask.tif`
    *   May contain subdirectories for:
        *   `masks/`: Raw segmentation masks.
        *   `tiles/`: If tiling was used, individual tile masks might be stored here before stitching.
        *   `summaries/`: JSON summaries from segmentation runs.
*   `data/processed/mapped/`
    *   Outputs from the transcript-to-cell mapping step.
    *   Should mirror the experiment structure.
    *   Example: `data/processed/mapped/experiment1/image_01_mapped_transcripts.csv`

### `data/results/`
Contains the final outputs of your analysis, such as visualizations, statistical summaries, reports, etc.

*   `data/results/experiment1/` (example for one experiment)
    *   `visualizations/`: Generated images (e.g., gene expression overlays).
        *   Example: `data/results/experiment1/visualizations/geneA_on_image_01.png`
    *   `statistics/`: Tables or files with quantitative results.
        *   Example: `data/results/experiment1/statistics/cell_counts_summary.csv`

## Usage Guidelines

1.  **Place original data** in the appropriate subdirectories under `data/raw/`. Try to maintain consistent naming and organization, especially if dealing with multiple experiments.
2.  **Pipeline Configuration**: Update paths in your `parameter_sets.json` and `src/file_paths.py` (if you modify these defaults) to point to these new data locations if your scripts expect inputs from or write outputs to these structured paths.
3.  **Version Control**: The `.gitignore` file in the project root is configured to ignore common large data file types within `data/raw/` and all content within `data/processed/` and `data/results/` (except for `.gitkeep` files which help maintain the directory structure in the repository).

This structure aims to keep your project organized, making it easier to manage data, reproduce results, and collaborate.

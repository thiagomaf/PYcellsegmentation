# Core TUI requirements (required for TUI to run)
textual>=0.60.0
textual-dev>=0.60.0
pydantic>=2.0.0
rich>=13.0.0

# Optional dependencies (lazy loaded - only needed for specific features)
# Install these if you want to use the corresponding features:

# Stats calculation (optimization dashboard)
# Note: Install numpy first, then opencv-python to avoid build issues
# numpy>=1.20.0  # Required for calculating statistics from segmentation results (2.x works with Python 3.14+)
# tifffile>=2021.0.0  # Required for reading TIFF mask files
# opencv-python>=4.5.0  # Required by pipeline_config_parser (works with numpy 2.x)
# scipy>=1.7.0  # Required for quality metrics calculation (Shapiro-Wilk test for log-normal distribution)
# scikit-image>=0.19.0  # Required for quality metrics calculation (regionprops for shape/topology metrics)

# Visualization packages
# plotext>=5.0.0  # For parameter coverage plots in parameter ranges editor
scikit-learn>=1.0.0  # For PCA in parameter space visualization and Gaussian Process regression
# pyDOE3>=1.6.0  # For Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) in optimization

# Bayesian optimization packages
scikit-optimize>=0.9.0  # For acquisition functions (UCB, EI, PI, LCB) in optimizer view
pymoo>=0.6.0  # For robust Pareto front calculation with NSGA-II/III algorithms
scipy>=1.7.0  # For optimization in GP-based suggestions

# Notes:
# - textual-plotext is NOT needed - we use plotext directly via PlotextStatic widget
# - numpy and tifffile are required for the "Calculate Stats" feature in optimization dashboard
# - All optional packages are lazy-loaded, so TUI will start without them
# - You'll get clear error messages if a feature requires a missing optional dependency
